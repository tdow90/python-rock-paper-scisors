# python-rock-paper-scisors

Making a simple rock paper scissors game in pythons, similar to what I did in JS in the first odin project. 

It should:
- Randomly choose cumputer choice
- ask for your choice, tell you if you win/lose
- keep playing until best of 5(first to 3)
- Then tell you you win lose the whole game.
